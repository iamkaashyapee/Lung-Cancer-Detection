# Lung Cancer Detection 🫁🧬

Welcome to the **Lung Cancer Detection** project!  
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline to detect lung cancer from medical datasets, providing a reliable tool for early diagnosis and research.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Early detection of lung cancer can save lives. This project uses **machine learning and data analysis** to predict the likelihood of lung cancer in patients based on their medical data.  

Key features:

- Preprocessing of medical datasets  
- Predictive models for lung cancer detection  
- Support for large datasets using Git LFS  
- Easy-to-use scripts for experimentation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamkaashyapee/Lung-Cancer-Detection.git
cd Lung-Cancer-Detection
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the project:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

> Make sure `dataset_med.csv` is in the repo (handled by Git LFS).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load and preprocess the dataset  
2. Train machine learning models on features  
3. Evaluate accuracy and performance metrics  
4. Make predictions on new patient data  

---

## 📈 Results

The project achieves high accuracy in predicting potential lung cancer cases, helping researchers and medical professionals make informed decisions.

## ⚠️ Note on Large Files

The main dataset (`dataset_med.csv`) is tracked using **Git LFS** to handle large file sizes efficiently. Make sure you have Git LFS installed before cloning the repo:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```
